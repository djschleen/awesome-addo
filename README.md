## Overview

[All Day DevOps](https://alldaydevops.com) (ADDO) just wrapped up on November 6 2019, and as I was moderating I was introduced to many tools that I had either never heard of before or that were too cool to not share.

Below is a list of some of the tools mentioned during my moderation sessions, and conversations with some of the speakers of the event.

Feel free to do a pull request and add any tools that you heard during the conference, or that you mentioned as a speaker. As I continue to listen to all the talks, I will add more content to this list.
